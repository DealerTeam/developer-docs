Test container for the FeatureManager Class


**Group** Test

## Methods
### `private static void validateClientId()`

`ISTEST`

This test method is hard to truely validate.  It is testing to see that a feature paramter for              DealershipManagementSystemId is always being set.  Due to the value being set by a feature paramter              we have no way to invalidate during a test method.
